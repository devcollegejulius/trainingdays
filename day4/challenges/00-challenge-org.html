For today a free plan is enough.
Next, you need to specify a global unique name for your organization an tell GitHub that the organization belongs to your personal account. After you have set all needed values, click <em>Next</em> and complete the setup. We don't need to add organization members now, because we want to do that in the next part of this challenge.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-new-org-form.c0cd6653.png" alt="GitHub new organization form"></p> <h2 id="invite-organization-members-an-assign-roles"><a href="#invite-organization-members-an-assign-roles" class="header-anchor">#</a> Invite organization members an assign roles</h2> <p>At the moment you are the <em>Owner</em> and the only one who can access the newly created organization. You can check this by navigating to the <em>People</em> section in the GitHub's navigation bar. The members list shows each member and their access level.
Owners have full access to teams, repositories and settings of the organization.
Of course we want to work with colleagues. We are now looking at how we can add our colleagues to the organization and what access rights we can give them. To add a new member, navigate to the <em>People</em> section, enter the invitee's email or GitHub handle and click <em>Invite Member</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-invite-member.cc895ce2.png" alt="GitHub Invite Member"></p> <p>Next, you need to specify the invitee's organization role.</p> <p><strong>Member:</strong>
Members can see all other members and can be granted access to repositories. They can create teams and repositories.</p> <p><strong>Owner</strong>
Owners have full administrative rights to the organization and have complete access to all repositories and teams.</p> <p>Actually, at least two people should be assigned to the Owner role. In this training, however, it is enough that there is only one owner. Therefore we assign the role <em>Member</em> to the invited person.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-invite-role-org.e4b96e32.png" alt="GitHub Invitation Member Role"></p> <p>After clicking <em>Send invitation</em> the invitee gets an email where the invitation can be accepted.
When we navigate back to the <em>People</em> section, we see that there is one pending invitation. The pending invitation state of the invitee is going to be changed as soon the invitee has accepted the invitation. The status of the invitee's pending invitation will be changed once the invitee has accepted the invitation.</p> <p>Wait until the invitee has accepted the invitation and verified that they have access to the organization.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù _If you want, the invitee can check if they can create a repository. It is be possible, because the Member role was assigned. But it is not possible to change settings of the organisation. Therefore the Settings section in the GitHub's navigation bar is not displayed. _</p></div> <h3 id="outside-collaborators"><a href="#outside-collaborators" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outside collaborators</h3> <p>When you look at the <em>People</em> section there is an entry named <em>Outside collaborators</em> under the <em>Organization permissions</em>. So, what is an <em>Outside collaborator</em>? An <em>Outside collaborator</em> is a person who isn't explicitly a member of your organization, but who has <em>Read</em>, or <em>Admin</em> permissions to one or more repositories of your organization.
This is useful when, for example, we are working with partner companies on a project but don't want partners to have organization-level access. Partners cannot view members of the organization and cannot create repositories. We only give partners access to selected repositories.
We will look at how to give <em>Outside collaborators</em> access to repositories later.</p> <h3 id="member-privileges"><a href="#member-privileges" class="header-anchor">#</a> Member privileges</h3> <p>As an organization <em>Owner</em>, we can manage <em>Members'</em> privileges. Navigate to the organization's <em>Settings</em> section in the GitHub's navigation bar and click <em>Manage privileges</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-member-privileges-org.ba953337.png" alt="GitHub Members privileges"></p> <p>Here you can manage what members of the organization are allowed to do. For example, if you want to control access to repositories for members, we need to look at <em>base permissions</em>. Per default, members can clone and pull all repositories within the organization, regardless if the repositories are public or private. If we want to restrict access to repositories as owner, we can set the value <em>None</em>. With this setting it is only possible to clone and pull public repositories. If members need access to a repository, we need to add them to teams or make them collaborators on individual repositories.
But it also works the other way around, members can be assigned more rights.  With <em>Write</em> and <em>Admin</em> members will get more access rights to each repository within the organization.</p> <p>For this challenge we leave it at the default setting.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-members-priv-base.bb8aae5c.png" alt="GitHub member privileges base permissions"></p> <p>Take your time and have a look at the other settings and feel free to discuss them within your team mates.</p> <h2 id="create-your-first-repository"><a href="#create-your-first-repository" class="header-anchor">#</a> Create your first repository</h2> <p>Now it is time to create your first repository and clone it to your local machine. Navigate to the <em>Repositories</em> section in the GitHub's navigation bar and click the green <em>New</em> button.
Give the repository a name e.g. <em>myfirst-repo</em> (If you want, you can add a description).
At this time, we want to make the repository private and choose later who can commit.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù <em>Since we have already invited a colleague as a member of the organization and used the default <em>Read</em> setting as Base permission in the member privileges, the invited colleague can clone and pull the newly created repository.</em></p></div> <p>Please initialize the repository with a <em>README</em> file.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>üìù <em>If you want, you can initialize the repository with a <em>.gitignore</em> file, by selecting a template.</em></p></div> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-new-repo.1273a8e2.png" alt="GitHub new repository"></p> <p>Click the <em>Create repository</em> button to create the repository.</p> <p>A GitHub repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. Currently, 2 people have access to the repository. You, as owner, have full access and your invited colleague has read access. Of course we want to work together on the repository. That's why we have to give the colleague write permissions. Therefore navigate to the repository's settings section and go to <em>Manage access</em>.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-repo-manage-access.6ed5cfd8.png" alt="GitHub repository manage access"></p> <p>In the <em>Who has access</em> area you can see that the repository is a private one.
Two members have <em>Read</em> access to the repository. You are the <em>Owner</em> of the repository and your invited colleague has <em>Read</em> access to it, because we have given members <em>Read</em> access to all repositories in the <em>Manage privileges</em> settings of the organization.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-repo-base-role.2e9694e1.png" alt="GitHub repository base role"></p> <p>There are two ways to give someone more access than the Base permission allows.</p> <p><strong>People:</strong>
Assigning individual people who are either members of the organization, or <em>Outside Collaborators</em>. An <em>Outside collaborator</em> is a person who isn't explicitly a member of your organisation.</p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong>
We can organize people into team, and assign rights to the team.</p> <p>In the next section we will create a <em>Team</em> and give it write access to the repository.</p> <h2 id="create-a-team-and-assign-permission"><a href="#create-a-team-and-assign-permission" class="header-anchor">#</a> Create a team and assign permission</h2> <p>Navigate to the <em>Teams</em> section  of your organization and click the green <em>New Team</em> button.
Name the Team <em>AzDC-Team</em> and give a description. At this time we make the team visible.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-new-team.06eea402.png" alt="GitHub new Team"></p> <p>After you have created the Team, you can add members in the <em>Members</em> section. Again, we have the option to add both members of the organization or <em>Outside collaborators</em>.
Now add the invited colleague to the team. After your colleague was added you can change their role within the Team. You can choose between <em>Member</em> and <em>Maintainer</em>.</p> <p><strong>Maintainer:</strong> Maintainers can add and remove team members and create child teams.</p> <p><strong>Member:</strong> A member has no administrative permissions to the team.</p> <p>For the moment we leave it at the role <em>Member</em>, which is the default.</p> <p>Next, we add the existing repository to the Team and grant write access. Navigate to the <em>Repositories</em> section within your Team and add the repository we created earlier.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-add-repo-to-team.c22c4b9c.png" alt="GitHub add repository to Team"></p> <p>After the repository was added, you can change the access level in the dropdown menu.</p> <p><img src="/trainingdays/assets/img/gh-team-reop-access-level.6f2ef2c1.png" alt="GitHub team's repo access level"></p> <p>In the dropdown menu all possible access levels are listed.
